# Workflow


- what you get in the OHI+ repo (very high-level: you get data and code, you'll operate with an R package ohicore)
- use RStudio, GitHub to work reproducibly and collaboratively
- how you work

## OHI+ Repo

- what is in the OHI+ repo, not file-by-file, but high-level

## RStudio-GitHub workflow

## How you work

- commit often (i.e. bundled as tasks you complete)
- use the Git tab to help you check your work -- what files updated, does that make sense?
