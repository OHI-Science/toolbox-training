# Introduction {#intro}

## Overview

The single biggest motivation of the Ocean Health Index project is to use science to inform marine management. And not just any science, the best available science, data, methods, and tools. Open data science is helping us get there, with transparency, reproducibility, collaboration, and communication at its core.

What is open data science? It is the marriage of open science and data science, which means science that anyone can access and reuse without much fuss. Open science is the idea that information will be available to those who need it, whether itâ€™s scientists that want to build from previous work without reinventing the wheel, or managers that want to use that science on the ground. It means that all methods, data, and reporting are available online for anyone to access. And data science is the science of turning raw data into understanding in a reproducible way, which means coding analyses and tracking changes with version control.

It is a daunting task to plan and conduct a multi-disciplinary, multi-stakeholder, highly collaborative assessment, and also focus on transparency and repeatability. But we have several open-science, collaborative tools to aid you in this process. All the tools we use aim to streamline the collaboration process and keep all records of decision making in one place. 

## What to expect

You are in the [Conduct Phase](http://ohi-science.org/projects/ohi-process/) of an OHI assessment, what is involved? 

The Conduct Phase is all about tailoring the conceptual **OHI framework** for your assessment area, and then tailoring the **OHI Toolbox** to calculate OHI scores for your assessment area (see figure below). 

You will take advantage of the core OHI features for the Framework and the Toolbox to help guide you along. This means you're not starting from scratch; you will build directly off of previous work by the OHI team's [global assessments](http://ohi-science.org/ohi-global/) and by the growing number of [OHI+ assessments](http://ohi-science.org/projects/ohi-assessments/).

The `ohicore` R package will calculate OHI scores. `ohicore` will take the information you tailor (status models, and your datafor status, trend, pressures, and resilience) and calculate the final scores as described in Halpern et al. 2012. 


## What you will do

We have developed conceptual guidance and computer code and architecture to streamline your assessment as much as possible. This will let you focus on tailoring the OHI for your assessment, instead of starting from scratch.

We strongly advocate transparency and repeatability throughout your assessment, which is why we emphasize collaborative documentation about all decisions made, and coding using open data science tools. 

### Tailoring the Conceptual Framework

You'll focus first on developing goal status models and gathering appropriate data. This will take ~1/3 of the total time for your assessment. There are a lot of decisions to make about what data to use and how to set reference points. Documenting these decisions are critical. 

**Here's what you will do:**

1. Understand how goal status models work, and what has been done in the past 
    - [ohi-science.org/goals](http://ohi-science.org/goals/)
    
2. Tailor the OHI Framework to your assessment area. This means gathering data and thinking about reference points as you develop goal status models. 
    - Gather data with the Data Planner: Chapters \@ref(gathering-data) and \@ref(planner-guide)

### Tailoring the OHI Toolbox

Next, you'll use the OHI Toolbox, which means your technical team will be coding in R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub. **It's important that you have already tailored the conceptual framework and have gathered the data you need before you begin using the Toolbox.** 

To learn the RStudio-GitHub workflow we use and describe in [Lowndes et al. 2017, *Nature Ecology & Evolution*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160), use this [training](http://jules32.github.io/2016-07-12-Oxford/overview/) (update in progress!).

1. Prepare your data layers. This will take another ~1/3 of the total time for your assessment.
    - [Request your starter repo](http://ohi-science.org/manual/#requesting-your-repositories)
    - Prepare Data: Chapter \@ref(prep-data)

1. Understand how the OHI Toolbox works 
    - [Request your full repo](http://ohi-science.org/manual/#requesting-your-repositories)
    - [Learn about the full repo](http://ohi-science.org/manual/#full-repository)
    - Learn how the Toolbox works (hands-on): Chapters \@ref(toolbox-ecosystem), \@ref(calcs-basic), \@ref(calcs-advanced)

1. Tailor the OHI Toolbox's goal status models for your assessment. This will take the final ~1/3 of the total time for your assessment.
    - [Modify goal models](http://ohi-science.org/manual/#modifying-goal-models)
    - [Modify pressures/resilience](http://ohi-science.org/manual/#modifying-pressures-and-resilience)


## Tools and Resources

During your OHI assessment you will mainly use a 

- **Google Drive folder** to collaborate with your whole team, and document thoughts and decisions about data and status goal models and reference points, etc
- **The OHI Toolbox** to organize and prepare data, and tailor goal status models

### Google Drive folder

In preparation of the Conduct phase of your project or your technical workshop, each OHI+ project is first provided a [Google Drive folder](link to folder). It contains presentations, workshop agenda, notes, and a OHI+ Planner. All materials are intended to be used during an OHI+ workshop and beyond. 

_Why Google Drive?_ OHI is a long-term, highly collaborative process. To make working together with multiple team members effecient, you will use many open-science tools, including Google Drive, Rstudio, and Github. Lets start with collaborating in Google Drive, where all participants can view and edit the same materials, and take notes. The advantage of using a shared Google Drive folder is that all your decision-making and insights are collected here in one place, rahter than in disparate emails or notes, or lost without even being recorded. 

Let's take a look inside and see how you can best use it. 

_Presentations and workshop agenda_ are fairly self-explanatory. They will help you navigate the workshop. 

_Notes_ will be used throughout the workshop. Rather than having individual participants taking their own notes and stitching them together later, your could assign a few master notetakers who collaboratively and simultaneously record questions and discussions in this one shared document, while others can focus on the discussion itself. Participants can refer back to these notes at any time online. 

_OHI+ Data Planner_ will be used most often during the workshop and after. It is a spreadsheet that organize and explore existing data to suit your Goals, Pressures, and Resilience, and to help you finalize spatial boundaries of your assessment. You'll learn how to use the Data Planner in Chapter \@ref(planner-guide).

_After you have used the Planner to explore data availability and conceptually map out the assessment, you can start using the OHI Toolbox to further prepare the data for calculations. At the start of your conduct phase, you will first get your Starter Repository._
