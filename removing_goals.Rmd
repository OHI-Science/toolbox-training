# Removing goals

NOTE: this filename/chapter will likely change, but this is where we'll talk about adding/removing goals/subgoals, and goals.csv. First will talk to Mel about goals.csv's future: maybe having them just written in functions.r, and have ohicore pull from that to make a full list

- goals.csv, adding goals, removing, changing subgoals. trend years. 

## Changing subgoals 

### Update goal call in `goals.csv`**

<!---TODISCUSS: maybe this detail should go somewhere else and then just referenced here? Because will also need this information referenced in the ## Removing Goals and ## Changing Subgoals sections --->

`goals.csv` in the `conf` folder provides input information for `functions.r`, particularly about function calls. These are indicated by two columns: *preindex_function* (functions for all goals that do not have sub-goals, and functions for all sub-goals) and *postindex_function* (functions for goals with sub-goals).

In the `preindex_fuction`, you could specify variables such as _status_year_ and _trend_year_, which you can call in your goal function. Note that it is not necessary to specify those variables. If you do not use them in your function as in the CS example, you could delete those variables in `preindex_function`.

_Changing goal weights will be done here by editing the value in the *weight* column. Weights do not need to be 0-1 or add up to 10; weights will be scaled as a proportion of the number of goals assessed. The ten goals are weighted equally by default._
