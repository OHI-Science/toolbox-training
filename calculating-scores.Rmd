    - runs the status, trend in functions.r, but also calculates pressures, resilience, lfs, and overall scores. 
    - score.csv updated, check that in Git tab of RStudio

## substituting new data layers

- and learning about functions

## developing goal models

- and adding new data layers
- workflow with `configure_toolbox.r`

## removing goals

## changing subgoals 

(these last 2 may be better in a different chapter really).
