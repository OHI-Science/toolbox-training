## Flower plots

Flower plots draw information from conf/goals.csv. 

Goal labeling for flower plots is set in goals.csv in the `name_flower` column. Add a carriage return `\n` between words in goal names to have them display on separate lines in the flower plots.

Include stuff about create_layers_rmds etc.
