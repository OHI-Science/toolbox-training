# The OHI Planner  {#planner-guide}

The purpose of Chapter \@ref(planner-guide) is to help you think about data for your assessment in a structured way. This is a 1-hour hands-on training: you will be following along on your own computer and working with a copy of the demonstration repository that is used throughout this chapter.

## Overview

A successful OHI+ assessment depends on representative data and models. With so much (or sometimes so little) information out there, how do you select the optimal data to be included in your study? How do you develop models that best reflect the conditions of your ocean health? How do you keep track of ideas you have and decisions you make? Here we have developed a OHI Planner to guide you through this important, yet sometimes daunting, process of data selection and model exploration. 

### Prerequisites

<!---Ning, do you want to add here what they need as prereqs? I suppose they need to make sure they have access to their Assessment's Google Drive folder, how do they get it, etc. --->

## Data Planner spreadsheet
<!---Ning, I think the spreadsheet is called "Data Planner", not "Planner" like below; do you want to change whichever one so that they match?--->

In the Google Drive folder that we shared with you, there is a spreadsheet called _Planner_. Let's open the planner in your folder and walk through how to use it together. 

<!---Ning, does this statement below mean three tabs? They have slightly different names and there are other tabs with examples, and a home page...just want to make sure we're super clear
--->
You'll see the next three panels to be filled out: Status, Pressures, and Resilience. We'll talk about each one of them in turn. 

## Status Data tab

Open up the "Status Data" tab, you'll see these headings, or columns to be evaluated for each goal:

This sheet is colored to help structure your thinking as you consider data. Generally you would want to work through this Planner from left to right. But note that _the process of building models, finding data, and defining spatial boundaries is iterative_. You might work on those components simultaneously in order to strike a balance between an ideal approach and data limitations. 

Let's walk through each header first. 

### Goals and subgoals

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vQF_jJF0FgtFoZiGf8oMEacVslyQZdO7uoYEvRi5_mEG2kCcR--t34mMj7GYrdBnv4M7RCNY-81Nvgw/pub?w=960&h=144)

In the Global assessment, we identified ten “goals” - universally valued benefits provided by the ocean. However, they might not be as relevant in your region. You may remove the goals that are irrelevant on the spreadsheet. 

You could also modify some of the goals. For example, the Natural Products goal strives to capture the non-food products humans extract from the ocean (eg. sea shells, minerals, etc). In Israel, people do not extract these resources on a notable scale, but they do rely on the ocean to provide drinking water through Desalination. Desalination replaces Natural Products as a goal in OHI-Israel. 

<!---Ning: note for above: in Israel they still call it the NP goal, it just uses desal data instead of shell data. Maybe a cleaner example here would be that the Baltic Sea doesn't get big storms because of its geography so they don't include Coastal Protection?

### Model + Data + Spatial Boundaries

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vQwRzxEuSxD09EyNUY5igXS7RdQFnk5XrAr3RXYkdBGzDIEMk73xWfR78urrju4oYTAy1TzRBJzFWFd/pub?w=960&h=144)

Model development and Spatial Boundaries can be developed simultaneously, particularly when gathering available data. <!---Ning I switched this wording but I don't think it's very good; but I thought "validating with data" was too vague. Maybe it needs another sentence or two?  --->

Let's look at these individually: 

**Represent goals with models**

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTFUwZQ6MKe-1ihCUMDWAv4yuX-D8oQnLYrGS4dEbMYIugvnj8j94sfquN9g09SMeHzg2GzKY4QyvPs/pub?w=960&h=125)

_What ideal indicators best represent the goal?_ For Tourism and Recreation, ideally you want to include both locals and tourists, and capture what activities they do and how often they enjoy them. However, it would be difficult to capture all those information in a model.  You will want to think through what are the most ideal indicators to capture information, then find data to represent those indicators. 

Different OHI+ projects have been creative at how they represent this goal as data permits. For example, Coastal activity Participation surveys can directly measure how often locals and tourists enjoy certain ocean activities. If that’s not available, hotel employment or hotel vacancy rate can be used as proxy indicators since they indirectly reflect how many visitors visit a region. 

Another important factor that determines OHI scores is _Reference Point_, ie. what status of this goal can be awarded a score of 100? Has the government set a target to achieve? Is there a model region that has become a standard other regions should aspire to? Is there a historical point the regions should return to?

**Find data for your ideal or proxy indicators**

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSoBJMg2MbiwD7xkQQEOD-v6YqOpajRpIbKeawYSfimytwxCPe1aSTyv0HmLfV6O5RCoqf9HqncZBtf/pub?w=960&h=125)

Choice of indicators and reference point are often limited by data availability, time frame, and resolution. 

Only one year of data is not enough to objectively reflect the status of a goal. 3-5 year data recommended. 

Data might need to be disaggregated from large-scale to small-scale. If you only have national level data for an indicator you’ll need to find ways to separate state-level data. 

### Examples 

Now we have run through the basic theories behind each column, let's walk through a few examples together over the next few panels of spreadsheets (Example 1 - 4). 

**Example 1 - Model & Indicators**

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSY6WtpVw6VzNfSBu_Mafu5JyTuSnIWh2yVdMi5jrC7xT4GJb7b6OmatsZoWSPGFyvSDnqDODVFsF5-/pub?w=960&h=240)

Models are relationships among indicators. Before gathering any data, think about ideal indicators that could represent the goal. How could each indicator be relevant/representative of ocean health? 

As you might have notices, to the right side of the sheet, there is a column for notes, in this case for Artisanal Fishing Opportunities (AO), Fish catch is deemed not suitable as an indicator here because it doesn't directly reflect the _capacity_ for artisanal fishing, which AO measures. 

**Example 2 - Data**

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTLmLMCMJMWzYW05Zhorwya3a1nB5uIZZ5vhHY0sjv6h-Cs4HSJCCm7tK_EBbv4o-Rygd3FRx21pIkS/pub?w=960&h=240)

Do you have data for each of the indicators you choose to use? What's the spatial resolution and temporal coverage? 

Spatial resolution should be compatible with the geopolitical boundaries of the regions in your study area. For example, if in your country, there are four provinces to be assessed, the spatial resolution from your data should be fine enough to extrapolate to the provincial level. 

Temporal coverage also matters. As OHI measures _trend_ for each goal, the trend is derived from ocean health status over time, ideally 5 years. 

**Example 3 - Spatial resolution**

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTlPhVKT-a9rJUkWOof6o2OIGudmQ-IMjeYr16QcIhwmvheZTGwjlxUeO9OszaBXEREUQU2B970JKZd/pub?w=960&h=240)

As mentioned above, data should be disaggregated to the regional level that you determine to be the optimal geopolitical boundaries of your study. 

In the data exploration process, however, you might find that the geopolitical boundaries you initially thought to be ideal are not supported by data. For example, if region 1 and 2 do not have independent data (eg. data can only be disaggregated from national level data and region 1 and 2 may end up with non-distinguishable data), you might consider combining region 1 and 2 into the same region for your assessment. 

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vQZjvRbXPAj_VKdJ4Nm5BfFSnivlr-d8K23qHY0HS9CBIcriifSVVIzll1GqpA3QD_lSMKINB_Drsg5/pub?w=960&h=336)

As you might have notices, there is a difference between "N" and "NA" for missing data. "N" is used when there is no known data for this region, even though there should be, as in the case of _Trash_ subgoal. You know there are people living in this region and there are trash on the beach, but this data has not been collected, you could put an "N" here. This data will need to be gap-filled (ie. extrapolated) from other known data. 

"NA" is used when there should be no data for this region. In this example, if no one lives in region 4, there would be no Livelihoods data for this region.  


**Example 4 - Reference Point**

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTR8bSMiV-QEovbuUOWOXBjeueRGXqIK1Z1kCa6DVprbWCo2HaPcl1ktjWP_mR8TWf-HHDvuZH64aJg/pub?w=960&h=240)

Reference points, or targets, are essential for rescaling and scoring. For example, if the target number of fishermen is 100, and the data only records 50, that could bring AO score down to 50. 

What the reference point for the indicators (or goal) should be? It could be from published policy targets, scientific studies, etc. It is not necessary that each indicator has a reference point, although most indicators need a reference point for rescaling.
