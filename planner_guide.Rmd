# OHI Planner  {#planner-guide}

The purpose of Chapter \@ref(planner-guide) is to help you think about data for your assessment in a structured way. This is a 1-hour hands-on training: you will be following along on your own computer and working with a copy of the demonstration repository that is used throughout this chapter.

## Overview

A successful OHI+ assessment depends on representative data and models. With so much (or sometimes so little) information out there, how do you select the optimal data to be included in your study? How do you develop models that best reflect the conditions of your ocean health? How do you keep track of ideas you have and decisions you make? Here we have developed a OHI Planner to guide you through this important, yet sometimes daunting, process of data selection and model exploration. 

We'll start by exploring the columns in the spread sheet and what they are for, and then walk through examples of how to fill them out. 

### Prerequisites

<!---Ning, do you want to add here what they need as prereqs? I suppose they need to make sure they have access to their Assessment's Google Drive folder, how do they get it, etc. 

Julie, I added one more sentence for people who don't start OHI+ from a workshop, such as Mike. So that they can download the doc as a separate document.--->

The OHI Data Planner is a document you can download online. It is housed in a Google Drive folder [link to it once it has a permanent location] that is shared with OHI participants before an OHI Technical Training workshop. Make sure you have access to the folder as there are other files in the folder to aid the process of the workshop. 

However, if you are using this document as a stand-alone document, you can downdoad it [here]() directly.

Click open the Planner, and let's walk through it together. 

## Data Planner spreadsheet

Information from the spreadsheet is not going to be used directly by the Toolbox. Rather, this Data Planner is built to help you think about data and start the collaborative OHI process before your technical team make calculations with R. So that participants who are not on the technical team can also contribute ideas here. 

The Data Planner serves as a way to track ideas of data and see what they look like or if they are possible to use for your assessment. It seems daunting to have to write down what you want the models to be, but here you can record simply what you're thinking, and what the ideal would be. It's a starting point that you can then share with your colleagues to think about together, and start looking for data. 

The data searching process is not a definitive phase of an assessment. You might find your initial data ideas not adequate or feasbile to use for calculations later, or they don't fit into the spatial boundaries you wanted to use. That's okay. OHI is an iterative process, and you can always come back to this spreadsheet and edit further. Having this spreadsheet thus serves as a collaborative note for your and your colleagues to record ideas for future references. 

There are three tabs to be filled out: Status Data, Pressures Data, and Resilience Data. Now let's take a look at each one of them. 

## Status Data tab

<!---Ning: something that doesn't come through as much that would be great if you could emphasize: this is a way to track ideas and see what they would look like/if they're possible. It seems intimidating to have to write down what you want the model to be and the reference points to be; this is where you can say what you're thinking, what the ideal would be; it's a starting point that you can then share with your colleagues to think about together, and start looking for data, etc. You say that it's iterative but I think to spend more time saying that in a few different ways and helping people see that this is a tool for them, and its structure is supposed to help them think and collaborate. Maybe even say that this is not going to be used directly by the Toolbox, this is for them to think about and collaborate with even if they don't know R or aren't on the technical team or whatever. It's in Google Docs to start the collaborative process and document (relying on Google's version control) as they go forward, etc...

Julie: added a few paragraphs above. please see if that carries through the ideas you mentioned.  
--->

Open up the "Status Data" tab, you'll see these headings, or columns to be evaluated for each goal: 

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vQCvSiXZdlEiThyX6_DWryKDOZImQFj_0dtVL4Co6YvupBx-60mx3amZqJ023vxRPhILeHehPxn9MIf/pub?w=960&h=96)

This sheet is colored to help structure your thinking as you consider data. Generally you would want to work through this Planner from left to right. But note that _the process of building models, finding data, and defining spatial boundaries is iterative_. You might work on those components simultaneously in order to strike a balance between an ideal approach and data limitations. 

Let's walk through each header first. 

### Goals and subgoals

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vQF_jJF0FgtFoZiGf8oMEacVslyQZdO7uoYEvRi5_mEG2kCcR--t34mMj7GYrdBnv4M7RCNY-81Nvgw/pub?w=960&h=144)

In the Global assessment, we identified ten “goals” - universally valued benefits provided by the ocean. However, they might not be as relevant in your region. You may remove the goals that are irrelevant on the spreadsheet. 

The Baltic Sea region doesn't get big storms because of its geography. The Coastal Protection goal is therefore irrelavent here and removed from this study. 

### Model + Data + Spatial Boundaries

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vQwRzxEuSxD09EyNUY5igXS7RdQFnk5XrAr3RXYkdBGzDIEMk73xWfR78urrju4oYTAy1TzRBJzFWFd/pub?w=960&h=144)

Goal models and Spatial Boundaries need to be considered simultaneously, particularly in the initial data gathering stage. Spatial boundaries based on political and geological boundaries are set at the beginning of a study, validated and maybe adjusted with data. For example, if you have 5 provinces to assess separately, and data for province 1 and 2 are reported together and difficult to tease apart, then you might need to consider combining region 1 and 2 into one region in your assessment. 

<!---Ning I switched this wording but I don't think it's very good; but I thought "validating with data" was too vague. Maybe it needs another sentence or two?  

Julie: see above--->

Let's look at these individually: 

**Represent goals with models**

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTFUwZQ6MKe-1ihCUMDWAv4yuX-D8oQnLYrGS4dEbMYIugvnj8j94sfquN9g09SMeHzg2GzKY4QyvPs/pub?w=960&h=125)

<!---Ning: since 'indicators' mean a lot of things to a lot of people, I think we should be careful about how we use it. So far in the Planner, we've only talked about data. I think it is important to also talk about how you can use indicators, but we need to say that explicitly and not just switch back and forth between 'data' and 'indicators'. What do you think? Maybe 'indicators' isn't the right thing to name that column. Maybe it should be 'data ideas' or something?

Also, since there is a full Example that you walk through after this short introduction, maybe it's better not to have this TR example now. It seems like this first section is just to give an overview of the column names. 

Julie: see below. may need more work. --->

_Model approaches?_ You don't need to decide on the mathmatical formula here. Together with the next "variables" column, this column mainly aims to get you start thinking of model approaches. Is the global OHI model adequate for your needs? What should the goal capture? <!--- Julie, I think maybe we should get rid of this column. It's very similar to the next column, since thinking about variables require people to understand the philosophy and other model approaches. It will also make this sheet less scary, and focus people's attention on variables and data gathering...--->

_What ideal variables best represent the goal?_ Before even thinking about data, let's think broadly, in your study area, what variables, or characteristics, of a goal best represent the philosophy of it, regardless if there is data available? 

Sometimes we tend to constrain our model development with the data we know we have. You can build a more representative model by thinking through what are _the most ideal variables_ (eg. popularity of a region among tourists) to capture information, then find _data that best reflect those variables_ (eg. hotel vacancy rates? international flights to this region? surf shop revenue? cruise ship revenue? etc).  

Different OHI+ projects have been creative at how they represent this goal as data permits. Check out the OHI-Science portal, Goals page ([ohi-science.org/goals](http://ohi-science.org/goals/)) page. It can help you understand the philosophy of a goal and shares what has been done. Let that catalyze your discussions. Do any of the past approaches suitable, or are there other obvious variables to better represent your goal in your country/region?

Another important factor that determines OHI scores is _Reference Point_, ie. what status of this goal can be awarded a score of 100? Has the government set a target to achieve? Is there a model region that has become a standard other regions should aspire to? Is there a historical point the regions should return to?

**Find data for your ideal or proxy model variables**

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSoBJMg2MbiwD7xkQQEOD-v6YqOpajRpIbKeawYSfimytwxCPe1aSTyv0HmLfV6O5RCoqf9HqncZBtf/pub?w=960&h=125)

Choice of model variables and reference points are often limited by data availability, time frame, and resolution. The data columns are a place to catelog a list of the data that could work: from your knowledge, when you ask your colleagues, digging through databases online, etc. Add as many rows as you need to to record your ideas. Having this master sheet of ideas will help you keep track of your thoughts and make collaboration with your collegues easier.  


<!---Ning:
I think you could flush this out a bit more with the overall comment above: this is a place to make a list of the data that could work: from your knowledge, when you ask your colleagues, digging through databases online, the gvt, etc. Add as many rows as you need to to catelog your ideas...

And for the text that you do have here I think you could explain a big; disaggregating isn't a concept that a lot of people have thought about with data so you'll need to explain that more, and explain by 3-5 years is recommended...I would say that it should be 5, but if that's not possible, fewer are possible...

Julie: see above and below. 
--->

_Years_: Typically having only one year of data is not enough to objectively reflect the status and trend of a goal. Five years of data are recommended. If that's not available, using fewing years of data is possible. 

_Spatial resolution_: When you find a data source (eg. national poverty level), you might need to be _disaggregate_, or separate the data from large-scale (eg. national) to small-scale (eg. provential). You could contact the agency that publishes the data and see if they have gathered small-scale data. If that's not possible, there are means (eg. GIS) to separate the large-scale data to local scales, although that could reduce the accuracy of the data. 


<!---Ning: you'll also want to explain the green and orange columns here too. And say that if you can add more columns for regions (and remind them what regions are)


Also, the pressures and resilience tabs too.

### Examples 

Now we have run through the basic theories behind each column, let's walk through a few examples together over the next few panels of spreadsheets (Example 1 - 4). 

**Example 1 - (Model &) Variables** <!--- Julie: maybe delete the model column, only have model variables, see earlier comments --->

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vSY6WtpVw6VzNfSBu_Mafu5JyTuSnIWh2yVdMi5jrC7xT4GJb7b6OmatsZoWSPGFyvSDnqDODVFsF5-/pub?w=960&h=240)

<!---Ning: It would be great to flush this out a lot more. What did you enter as indicators and why? Walk through the thought process behind them (maybe not all of them, but enough to get a good sense. This is the thinking that we need to teach people.
--->

Models are relationships among variables. Before gathering any data, think about ideal variables that could represent the goal. How could each variable be relevant/representative of ocean health? 

In this example, [artisanal fishing opportunities](http://ohi-science.org/goals/#artisanal-fishing-opportunities) measure whether people who need to fish on a small, local scale have the opportunity to do so. Thus the variables need to reflect the _need_ for artisanal fishing, how easy or hard it is for fishermen to _access_ ocean resources when they need them, and the _sustainability_ of harvest of all fish stocks that fishermen use. 

_The number of artisanal fishermen_ and/or _the number of people below poverty line_ could reflect the need for artisanal fishing. 

_Fish stock health_ can tell the sustainability of fishing in the region. 

_Catch_ might be unsuitable, because it reflects the amount fished in the past, not the sustainable capacity for artisanal fishing. The fish stocks might have been over- or under- fished in the past. 

_Gas price_ and _number of ports_ could limit the fishermen's ability to access ocean resources. 

As you might have noticed, to the right side of the sheet, there is a column for **notes**. In this case for Artisanal Fishing Opportunities (AO), Fish catch is deemed not suitable for the reasons stated above. _It's just as important to document the rationales for excluding a data source as it is to record why you included one._ 

**Example 2 - Data**

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTLmLMCMJMWzYW05Zhorwya3a1nB5uIZZ5vhHY0sjv6h-Cs4HSJCCm7tK_EBbv4o-Rygd3FRx21pIkS/pub?w=960&h=240)

<!---Ning: same as above, I think you can flush this out a bit more. Walk through the rows you introduce above and say what you enter on the sheet. Maybe make some dummy data and take a screenshot if that makes sense, or just describe it.
--->

These few columns detail the data you find for each of the variables you decided suitable for your model. 

Are data available? For fish stock health, there is no readily accessible datasets. So this variable can't be used in your study. But other variables seem to have data. 

Are they from a credible source? The quality of your assessment depends on the quality of your data. Government agencies (eg. Energy Information Administration), or research institutes tend to be more credible. <!---anything else to include? NGO? not all provide relialbe data though...--->

How many years does it cover? As OHI measures _trend_ for each goal, the trend is derived from ocean health status over time, ideally 5 years. In this case, there is sufficient data (1950-2016). 

Also, what's the spatial resolution of this source? Spatial resolution should be compatible with the geopolitical boundaries of the regions in your study area. If the source only provides a national average, but the assessment requires provincial-level data, you need to look further. 


**Example 3 - Spatial resolution**

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTlPhVKT-a9rJUkWOof6o2OIGudmQ-IMjeYr16QcIhwmvheZTGwjlxUeO9OszaBXEREUQU2B970JKZd/pub?w=960&h=240)

As mentioned above, data should be disaggregated to the regional level that you determine to be the optimal spatial boundaries of your study. 

In the data exploration process, however, you might find that the geopolitical boundaries you initially thought to be ideal are not supported by data. For example, if region 1 and 2 do not have independent data - that data can only be disaggregated from national level data, and region 1 and 2 may end up with non-distinguishable data, you might consider combining region 1 and 2 into the same region for your assessment. 

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vQZjvRbXPAj_VKdJ4Nm5BfFSnivlr-d8K23qHY0HS9CBIcriifSVVIzll1GqpA3QD_lSMKINB_Drsg5/pub?w=960&h=336)

Sometimes there isn't data available, and sometimes data isn't relevant to a region, e.g. if there are no mangroves growing in Region 4. So it's important to have a system for distinguishing these two things. Here, we'll use _NA_ if it's not relevant; that's the syntax that `R` and the OHI Toolbox will use so we can be consistent. When data are not available but they should be, here we'll mark it with an _N_. 

"NA" is used when there should be no data for this region. In this example, if no one lives in region 4, there would be no Livelihoods data for this region.  


**Example 4 - Reference Point**

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTR8bSMiV-QEovbuUOWOXBjeueRGXqIK1Z1kCa6DVprbWCo2HaPcl1ktjWP_mR8TWf-HHDvuZH64aJg/pub?w=960&h=240)

<!---Ning: I think the fisherman example is too simplistic and a bit misleading, and in the screenshot it's temporal v. spatial...I think you want to explain the thinking behind temporal v. spatial here instead of the specific number examples. 

--->

Reference points, or targets, are essential for rescaling and scoring. For example, if the target number of fishermen is 100, and the data only records 50, that could bring AO score down to 50. 

What the reference point for the indicators (or goal) should be? It could be from published policy targets, scientific studies, etc. It is not necessary that each indicator has a reference point, although most indicators need a reference point for rescaling. 

_Gas prices_ fluctuates often. It's difficult to set a reference point where it's optimal. You could set the reference point to be
