# Home {#home}

**Welcome.**   

**This training program is under active development and testing** â€” development is currently focused on Chapters \@ref(data-science) and \@ref(toolbox-ecosystem). Chapters \@ref(prep-data) and \@ref(calcs-basic) are nearly complete, and we are also outlining other chapters.


Each chapter has materials for a 2-hour hands-on training. These training materials can be used to teach or can serve as a self-paced workshop without guided instruction. 


<!---
TODO, including: 

- first X chapters are overview of the workflow, independent from Toolbox
- next X chapters are Tbx specific

TODO @jules32: citation information --->
