# Welcome {#welcome}

This book will help you learn to use the OHI Toolbox. Each chapter is hands-on training that we use to teach, but they can also be used as self-paced learning.
 
**OHI assessments use collaborative open software so that they are transparent and reproducible.** Openness is important for science and especially solution-driven science; we've shared how we work and why in a new publication in *Nature Ecology & Evolution:* [Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160). It's open access (available for free), and there are also accompanying interviews and press listed [here](http://ohi-science.org/betterscienceinlesstime/) that you can read to get more of a sense of why we work the way we do. 

***This training program is under active development and testing***

- first X chapters are overview of the workflow, independent from Toolbox
- next X chapters are Tbx specific
