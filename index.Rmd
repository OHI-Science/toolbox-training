# Welcome {#welcome}

TEST

**Welcome. This training program is under active development and testing.**

The single biggest motivation of the Ocean Health Index is to use science to inform marine management. And not just any science, the best available science, data, methods, and tools.
OHI assessments use collaborative open software so that they are transparent and reproducible; we call this software the OHI Toolbox.
  
Openness is an important part of how we work; we describe how and why in Lowndes *et al.* 2017, *Nature Ecology & Evolution:* [Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160). 

This book will train you to prepare for and use the OHI Toolbox. It can be used to teach workshops or for self-paced learning.
