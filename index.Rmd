# Welcome {#welcome}


 
**OHI assessments use collaborative open software so that they are transparent and reproducible; we call this software the OHI Toolbox.**   
  
Openness is an important part of how we work; we describe how and why in Lowndes *et al.* 2017, *Nature Ecology & Evolution:* [Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160). 

This book will train you to prepare for and use the OHI Toolbox. It can be used to teach workshops or for self-paced learning.

***This book is under active development and testing***
