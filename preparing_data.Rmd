# Preparing data: Basic {#prep-data}

The purpose of Chapter \@ref(prep-data) is to introduce you to the basic workflow for preparing data for OHI. This is a a 2-hour hands-on training: you will be following along on your own computer and working with a copy of the demonstration repository (_toolbox-demo_) that is used throughout the this chapter.


## Overview

Preparing data takes the biggest chunk of time when you're using the OHI Toolbox, even more than the final scores calculation itself. That when you explore raw data, see whether it fits with your ideal spatial boundaries and whether it makes sense to include it in your final calculations. If it does, you can format it further and save it as data layers, or Toolbox inputs for scores calculations.

The _Starter Repo_ \@ref(ecosystem) aims to help you wade through these important first steps of the assessment. Treat the prepatory, or "prep", files as your notebook, calculator, and presentation of your work. Here, the process of data exploration is recorded and can be easily shared with anyone.

<!-- MOVE THESE TO ECOSYSTEM SECTIONS? **Why prepare data in the Toolbox?** This is for transparency, reproducibility, and credibility. If someone wants to understand what data you're using, how you have processed it, and your rationale for including it or excluding other options, they can find the answers here. With this reproducible record, you will be able to repeat these methods with additional years of data using the same code you have already written. It also makes your technical team more stable. If there are personale changes, your team memory is preserved. It's easier for new members to pick up where it was left when your data preparation has been documented clearly and kept in one place.  -->

<!-- **Why R Markdown?** R Markdown produces a report with your comments, `R` code, and figures/tables embedded in it. It can be rendered as a nice HTML webpage that is easy to update and share with other people. We highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in open science, especially OHI+ users. -->

In this chapter, we will go through the basic requirements and steps of preparing a data layer: 

- understand the formatting requirements
- try a hands-on tutorial in which you can use sample data to format and save
- register a data layer

_**Prerequisites**_

Before the training starts, please make sure you have done the following: 

1. Have up-to-date versions of `R` and RStudio and have RStudio configured with Git/GitHub 
    - https://cloud.r-project.org
    - http://www.rstudio.com/download 
    - http://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html 
    
1. Fork the **toolbox-demo** repository into your own GitHub account by going to https://github.com/OHI-Science/toolbox-demo, clicking "Fork" in the upper right corner, and selecting your account

1. Clone the **toolbox-demo** repo from your GitHub account into RStudio into a folder called "github" in your home directory (filepath "~/github")

1. Get comfortable: be set up with two screens if possible. You will be following along in RStudio on your own computer while also watching an instructor's screen or following this tutorial.

After your `toolbox-demo` repository is set up, open the `prep` folder. It should look like this: 

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1JOeYc-4Izf3h9FHPKQhkTou2uZgOB8dh0melYhV5s44/pub?w=450)

Each goal and sub-goal has its own sub-folder, so you can store raw and intermediate data as you work in R Markdown (or `R`). It is highly recommended that data preparation occurs in the `prep` folder as much as possible, as it will also be archived by GitHub for future reference. 

But before we start preparing a data layer, let's first go over the data formatting requirements. 

## Data Formatting requirements

A data layer is a data file used to calculate scores. The global analysis included over 100 data layer files, and there will probably be as many in your own assessments. Each data layer (data input) **has its own _.csv_ file**. These data layers are combined to calculate goal scores, meaning that they are inputs for status, trend, pressures, and resilience.

>The OHI Toolbox expects each _.csv_ file to have:

>- data for every region within the study area
>- a unique region identifier (*rgn_id*) associated with a single score or value.
>- data organized in 'long' format (as few columns as possible.) 

**OHI goal scores are calculated at the scale of the reporting unit**, which is called a ‘**region**’ and then combined to produce the score for the overall area assessed, called a ‘**study area**’. For example, the _U.S._ is a _study area_, and each _coastal state_ is a _region_. 

In addition, to calculate trend, input data should be available as a time series for **at least 5 recent years** - and the longer the better, as this can be used in setting temporal reference points.

>Finalized data layers have at least two columns: the `rgn_id` column and a column with data identified by its units (eg. _km2_ or _score_). There often may be a `year` column or a `category` column (for natural product categories or habitat types).

Below are examples of two different data layer files: tourism count (`tr_total.csv`) and natural products harvested (`np_harvest_tonnes.csv`). They show information for a study area with 4 regions. Each region has multiple years of data. And the second data layer has an additional 'categories' column for the different types of natural products that were harvested. 

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Hydt117b7mFAcq4wkmdGKfPWq2Kn_1EVpfyL-zkzx-o/pub?w=500)

In this example, the two data layers are appropriate for _status calculations_ with the Toolbox because:

1. At least five years of data are available
2. There are no data gaps
3. Data are presented in 'long' or 'narrow' format (_You can read more about long formatting [here](http://ohi-science.org/manual/#long-formatting)_).




_When data gaps, temporal or spatial, are inevitable, various gap-filling techniques can be used. We won't go through the details here. For more information and examples, visit [OHI Manual](http://ohi-science.org/manual/#gapfilling)_ 

## Data Wrangling

So how do we get from raw data to a data layer that looks like the ones shown above? When we first access a data set, we often don't know whether it is suitable for our purpose, or if it provides adequate information. Raw data can be in a different format than the desired long format and have extra or incomplete information. The main task of data preparation is to comb through the raw data, combine different sources, and sometimes fill in the infomration gap. We call this process "data wrangling." 

For reproducibity and transparency, it is also good practice to record and share the decision-making process - trials and errors, why you decide to include, or more importantly, exclude a certain data source. Fortunately, we can take notes on the data exploration process and code in one place!

Here is an [example](https://github.com/OHI-Science/bhi/blob/draft/baltic2015/prep/CW/eutrophication/eutrophication_prep.md) of a data prep document. Let's give it a try to make one just like this. 

Now let's switch to the `demo` repo. Today we will use the _Clean Water (CW)_ goal as an hands-on example. Click on the `CW` folder and open `CW_data_prep.Rmd`. We will follow the tutorial from there.

## Save and Register data layers 

Before processed data can be used by the Toolbox for calculations, they need to be saved and registered here: 

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1IwHf8pMBlpzOIYKL0hoEF5rETGA765Qtwkz7es7B3Rg/pub?h=500)

You have in the data prep script saved the data layer in `layers` folder, now let's register it so that OHI Toolbox knows where to look for data when you calculate scores. 

## Register data layers in `layers.csv`  

After we have saved a data layer in `layers` folder, we will catalogue the layer in `layers.csv`. `layers.csv` is a registry that contains information about each layer - which goal it is used for, filename, column names, etc., and it will direct ohicore to appropriate data layers during calculations. 

![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1juueRiA0gevOoHH_8owzLNanyQ-H1mAOEl7L_l5YSJ0/pub?h=600) 

If a layer simply has a new filename, only the *filename* column needs to be updated:

However, **if a new layer has been added (for example when a new goal model is developed)**, you will open `layers.csv` in a spreadsheet software (i.e. Microsoft Excel), add a new row in the registry for the new data layer and fill in the first eight columns (columns A-H):

 + **targets:** Add the goal/dimension that the new data layer relates to. Goals are indicated with two-letter codes and sub-goals are indicated with three-letter codes, with pressures, resilience, and spatial layers indicated separately.
 + **layer:** Add an identifying name for the new data layer, which will be referenced in R scripts like `functions.R` and *.csv* files like `pressures_matrix.csv` and `resilience_matrix.csv`.
 + **name:** Add a longer title for the data layer.
 + **description:** Add a longer description of the new data layer.
 + **fld_value:** Add the appropriate units for the new data layer. It is _the same as the column name in the data file_, which will be referenced in R scripts in subsequent calculations. (example: area_km2)
 + **units:** Add a description about the *units* chosen in the *fld_value* column above. Think about what units you would like to be displayed online when filling out "units." (example: km^2)
 + **filename:** Add a filename for the new data layer that matches the name of the *.csv* file that was created previously in the `layers` folder.
 + **fld_id_num:** Area designation that applies to the newly created data layer, such as: *rgn_id* and *fao_id*.

 It is important to check that you have filled you the fields correctly, for instance, if "fld_value" does not match the header of the source data layer, you will see an error message when you try to calculate scores. Other columns are generated later by the Toolbox as it confirms data formatting and content.

_If a layer simply has a new filename, only the *filename* column needs to be updated._
