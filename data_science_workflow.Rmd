# Data science workflow {#data-science}

**In development.** 


- what you get in the OHI+ repo (very high-level: you get data and code, you'll operate with an R package ohicore)
- use RStudio, GitHub to work reproducibly and collaboratively
- how you work

## OHI+ Repo

- what is in the OHI+ repo, not file-by-file, but high-level
- prep and full repos

## RStudio-GitHub workflow

## How you work

- commit often (i.e. bundled as tasks you complete)
- use the Git tab to help you check your work -- what files updated, does that make sense?

## Developing these skills {#develop-skills}

2-day self-paced workshop: [Reproducible Science with RStudio and GitHub](http://jules32.github.io/2016-07-12-Oxford/overview/). This is a [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) workshop by our team to help you develop skills with the RStudio/GitHub workflow.

## Practice by updating your website

- give a face to your project


### Branches: master and gh-pages

#### What you need to know 

super powerful; parallel universe workspace. we'll just be taking advantage of the gh-pages, special branch.

#### Setting up

#### Switching branches

- make sure you've committed and pushed before switching (I compuslively pull each time again, just to be sure)
- if you have scripts open, it may say that they don't exist anymore and would you like to delete them. Say yes. They do exist, just in a different branch
